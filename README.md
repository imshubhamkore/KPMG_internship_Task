## KPMG_Internship_Task

Data has enormous power. It is the most sought-after and expensive commodity in the world. To use that data to gain useful insights and develop a strategic business plan is an art in itself that many calls as #dataanalytics. 
I completed the KPMG #DataAnalytics #Virtual #Consulting #Internship recently by the #forage. There, you will be required to solve three tasks: data quality assessment, data insights, and data presentation.
You will be free to choose any #technology and platform to achieve the best results. You will have access to the perfect response provided by a KPMG consultant after you submit your response, allowing you to compare the two, find the flaws, and make improvements. That is what I loved the most about this #experience, the chance to learn on my own by #research, making mistakes and correcting them.
